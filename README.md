# Kenya_Maize_Market_Analysis
This project conducts a detailed data-driven analysis of maize production trends in Kenya from 2012 to 2018. It explores spatial and temporal patterns, identifies top-producing counties, models future supply forecasts, and provides strategic recommendations for boosting productivity, trade, and resilience in the maize sector.

## 📈 Key Analyses

- 📊 **Reshaped and Cleaned** maize production data (area harvested, yield, output)
- 🌍 **County-Level Mapping** using GeoPandas & Plotly (interactive maps)
- 📉 **National Production Trend** analysis and visualizations
- 🔮 **Forecasting (ARIMA)** maize supply through 2028
- 🧭 **Strategic Recommendations** and roadmap for stakeholders

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- ⚠️ Inconsistent data formatting across sources (wide-format CSVs and spatial GeoJSONs)
- 🔍 Missing data and outliers affected trend and cluster integrity
- 📉 Limited availability of input-level and climatic data constrained deeper productivity modeling

---

## 🌟 Opportunities

- Targeted support for top-performing regions (e.g., Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu)
- Deployment of smart extension services in low-yield counties
- Integration of climate and input-use data for deeper predictive analytics

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**, **Pandas**, **GeoPandas**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
- **ARIMA** (via `statsmodels`) for time-series forecasting
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development
- **MS Word** / `python-docx` for automated report generation

---

## 🧭 Roadmap for Scaling

1. **Short-Term (0–1 year)**: Improve data collection, validate sources, harmonize county names.
2. **Mid-Term (1–3 years)**: Expand digital advisory platforms, deploy regional extension pilots.
3. **Long-Term (3–5 years)**: Build resilient, climate-smart supply chains and structured trade systems.
